### Dragon Born Seraphina

#### #3 Magic Nights

![cover](/assets/covers/Magic-Nights.jpg)

After surviving the trials of the Magic Games, mercenary mage Sera Dering is back home in San Francisco. She wants nothing more than to relax and finally have a long-overdue date with dragon shifter Kai.

Unfortunately, the universe has other plans.

When one of Kai’s employees is discovered dead, he enlists Sera’s help to solve the magical mystery surrounding the death. And sometime between fighting monsters, rescuing kidnapped children, thwarting pirates, and convincing a grumpy ghost to help her, Sera is determined to finish their date.

### Dragon Born Alexandria

#### #1 Magic Edge

![cover](/assets/covers/Magic-Edge.jpg)

Mercenary mage Alex Dering has spent most of her life killing deadly monsters for only peanuts in return—until the world’s most legendary immortal hires her for a prestigious assignment in Europe. In return for hunting down misbehaving supernaturals, he’s going to pay her a boatload of cash.

But a straightforward slash and burn extermination in Zurich gets a whole lot more complicated for Alex when a gang of vampires steals one piece of a magical artifact that, once assembled, has the power to kill every supernatural in the city. Well out of her depth, she’s forced into a precarious partnership with a notorious assassin, a man as seductive as he is deadly. With a band of killers hot on their trail, Alex has no choice but to trust him—even if that trust could expose her most guarded secret.

#### #2 Blood Magic

![cover](/assets/covers/Blood-Magic.jpg)

Branded as an abomination, Dragon Born mage Alex Dering has spent her whole life hiding what she is—a secret her father died to protect. Eight years after his death, Alex finally gets the chance to track down the mage responsible.

But her vengeance is put on hold when she gets a lead in London on the Blood Orb, a magical artifact with the power to control vampires. Retrieving the orb from the hate group that holds it won’t be easy; thwarting their plan to exterminate every supernatural in the world will be even harder.

To make matters worse, a mysterious killer is stalking Alex’s every move, determined to end her life. To survive this, it will take all her magic, a lot of help from a dangerous ally, and a really big sword.
